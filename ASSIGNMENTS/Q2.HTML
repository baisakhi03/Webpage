    <p>Cascading style sheets,commonly known as CSS,is a fundamental technology
        for web development that complements HTML(HYpertext Markup Language). <br>
        CSS serves as a styling language that allows web designers and developers to control
        the presentation and layout of web content ,including text,images and other HTML elements. <br>
        It plays a crucial role in separating the structure and content of a webpage from its visual design.
